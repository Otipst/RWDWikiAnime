It began serialization in Square Enix's Gangan Joker in March 2014, with its chapters additionally collected into sixteen tankōbon volumes as of September 2022.

        The story of Kakegurui Compulsive Gambler takes place at Hyakkaou Private Academy, a prestigious school with a student hierarchy developed through gambling. Yumeko Jabami is a transfer student with a gambling addiction. By counteracting the cheating methods of other gamblers, Yumeko disrupts the students' success and status.

The anime series has been licensed and streamed by Netflix outside of Japan. Two light novels based on the manga have been released by Square Enix in August 2017 and March 2019, respectively. A live-action drama adaptation aired in Japan from January to March 2018, while a second season aired in April 2019.

      </div>  
    <p>Setting
      Kakegurui – Compulsive Gambler is set at Hyakkaou Private Academy, a high-class elite school housing the children of Japan's wealthiest and most influential people, with many future leaders and professionals among the student body. However, the student hierarchy in this school is not determined by academic performance or athletic ability, but rather by gambling.
      
      Students are ranked by their monetary contributions to the Student Council, which fuels an intricate gambling system where students freely bet their fortunes against one another after class. Those who win earn popularity, prestige and connections, while those who lose and fall into debt become slaves to the whims of the remainder of the student body known as Pets, nicknamed "Fido" or "Mittens" ("Pochi" or "Mike" in the original) depending on gender and identified with a collar-like tag around their necks. Pets who are unable to clear their debts by the graduation receive "Life Schedules" which dictate their futures as they work to pay off their debts.</p>
